# STEP 1:
# MADE A SPECIFIC FILE, FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING THE RESULTS CALLED graph_calc.py
# ALSO USING THE IMPPORT MATH LIBRARY FOR THE PROBLEM Sin(x) and Cos(x)
# AFTER THAT I'VE MADE A CLASS NAMED GraphGenerator, WITH THE METHODS graph1 to graph10
# EACH GRAPH WILL HAVE A SPECIFIC TXT, SO IN TOTAL THERE ARE 10 OUTPUT FILES, THE NAMES BEING graph(1-10)_result.txt

# I'VE MADE A SEPARATE FOLDER WITH SCREENSHOTS WITH THE SPECIFIC CODE AND THE OUT PUT OF IT.

# STEP 2:
# AFTER I'VE MADE THE CACULATIONS AND WROTE THE FILES IN THEIR SPECIFC TXT FILE.
# I GAVE THE USER 3 OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM TYPING THE NUMBER 1 WILL ASK THE USER WHAT SPECIFIC GRAPH THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE.
# 1 GIVNG THE USER A CHOICE WHICH THEY WANT TO SEE FROM 1-10, ONCE THE USER HAS CHOOSEN THE SPECIFIC TXT FILE, THE PROGRAM WELL THEN READ THE RESULT FROM 1 TO 50, AND GRAPH 
# 2 FOR SHOWING ALL, I USED A FOR LOOP WITH A RANGE OF(1,11) TO EACH READ MY TXT FILE INDIVIDUALLY, DOING SO WILL PUT THEM ALL IN A SINGLE GRAPH
# 3 FOR EXITING THE PROGRAM
